Frontend interview task for FLK It Over.

The instructions for the task are contained within the code. Some of the components use react-final-form, but you donâ€™t need to know anything more than you can find in the [Field docs](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/Field) and the [Form docs](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/Form).

Please spend no longer than 1 hour on the task and upload the finished version to a github repo. Contact us if you have any questions. 

To get started run `npm i` and `npm run dev`.

Best of luck! :)
